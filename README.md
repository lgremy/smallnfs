# A small implementation of NFS

## Aim of the project

This small implementation of NFS proposes a very simple implementation of the different step of NFS to compute discrete logarithms in prime fields.

Details of this implementation are described in Laurent Gr√©my's thesis.

## How to use

With [Sage](http://www.sagemath.org/) 8.0, simply launch ```sage smallnfs.sage```. It will compute an individual logarithm in GF(6283185307179586476925547). You can easily modify the parameters by modifying the lines after ```Data```.
